# Analysis-of-Police-Incidents-in-SF-2017

## Summary
Living in the Bay Area, we love San Francisco, it is a beautiful city. But sometimes we are also concerned about safety issues in the city. I'd like to conduct an analysis and create visualziations to get a good understanding about the crime incidents happened in San Francisco, so we can be more aware. I found the interesting dataset about the police incidents in 2017 on data.sf.org. The main fields that we used are the columns about police incident categories, date and time of the incidents and the police district and location information of the incidents. I mainly used Pandas and Numpy modules to do analysis, and Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualzations and gain interesting and useful insights.

## Key Visualizations
